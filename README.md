<h1>Flatline's Arsenal - Gunpath DLC &amp; Burst Fire for Cyberpunk Red</h1>
<p>This module adds two main components to your Cyberpunk Red Foundry VTT game:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Burst Fire</h3>
<p>Burst Fire is a world script that runs in the background. When you fire a weapon the game will check if you have an upgrade named ‘Burst Fire’ installed. It will check what number the burst fire is, and then adjust normal and aimed shots for whatever the value of the burst fire upgrade has been selected. The script will not work if the burst fire is less than 2, or if you're firing a bow, crossbow, grenade launcher, rocket launcher, or hucking a grenade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three items included in Burst Fire-&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Burst Fire 2</li>
    <li>Burst Fire 3</li>
    <li>Burst Fire # (Template)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Burst Fire 2 &amp; 3 should be sufficient for most guns, but if you wish to create a bigger burst fire mod, duplicate the template item, edit the name, and replace # with the total number of bullets you want fired in the burst. Instructions are in the template's description.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Cyberpunk Red's Gunpaths DLC &amp; Homebrew</h3>
<p>The second half of this module is a series of Gun Generators that cover a number of ways to create new firearms in Cyberpunk. These include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Toggle's Temple Gunpath (RAW) - This is the unaltered gunpath generator as released in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rtalsoriangames.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/RTG-CPR-DLC-TogglesTemplev1.1.pdf">Toggle's Temple DLC</a> from R Talsorian Games. If you want the strict DLC generator, select this option.</li>
    <li>The Gunpath - This generator has a houserule that includes a 16-25%, depending on the weapon, chance of not having any attachments. This allows you to generate “normal” CPR weapons that are branded and have a little bit of personality to them.</li>
    <li>Gunpath Deluxe - This is a houseruled version of the Gunpath that includes two potential drawbacks to each generated weapon and 0-3 attachments rolled. The Gunpath tends to create weapons that are less expensive than buying a gun &amp; upgrades and then assembling it. To compensate for that, I've included some ideas on drawbacks. Feel free to add your own to the drawbacks roll table to suit your game. They are optional, and the GM is free to adjust as necessary.</li>
    <li>207X Gunpath - This is The Gunpath but with the possibility to roll Cyberpunk Edgerunner Mission Kit rebuilds. There are three upgrades in this part of the module for Tech, Power, and Smart. At this time, they are placeholders and don't have any mechanical effect on the game other than to remind you that the gun has a rebuild upgrade. The drawbacks and multiple attachments are not part of this gunpath at this time. Sometime in the future, a 207X Deluxe Gunpath may be made available if there's interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to use: Import the Gunpath Macro that you want to use from the compendium and drag it to your toolbar. Once rolled, you will need to create the weapon manually in the item tab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a handful of guns generated using the various gunpaths for an example of how the weapons can be built out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>At this time, Burst Fire Mode is <i>only</i> compatible with Foundry v11. This is due to CPR not being released for v12 yet. v10 compatibility will not be undertaken.</li>
    <li>Cyberpunk Red Core System v0.88.2- At this time, this is the most recent compatible version of the system. I will not support earlier versions. </li>
    <li>Burst Fire requires tokens to be on the canvas to work at this time.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should cause little to no conflicts, but as always, you may wish to back your world up before installing.&nbsp;</p>
