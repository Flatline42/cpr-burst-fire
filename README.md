<h1>Burst Fire Mode- A combat module for use with Foundry VTT Cyberpunk Red</h1>
<p>This module adds two items and a world script to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/cyberpunk-red-core">Foundry VTT Cyberpunk Red system</a>. When Burst Fire 2 or Burst Fire 3 upgrades are installed in guns, they trigger on standard and aimed attacks to fire in either 2 or 3 round bursts. In the event of insufficient ammo for the burst and a shortened burst, a card will be posted to the chat room. Suppressive and Autofire are not impacted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should allow you to build out Cyberpunk Edgerunner Mission Kit weapons that fire in 2 and 3 round bursts. If you use the gunpath generator, this is also handy for giving a “down side” to gunpath guns that are one or two tiers cheaper than they would otherwise be due to that generator's way of determining gun prices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
    <li>At this time, Burst Fire Mode is <i>only</i> compatible with Foundry v11. This is due to CPR not being released for v12 yet. v10 compatibility will not be undertaken.</li>
    <li>Cyberpunk Red Core System v0.88.2- At this time, this is the most recent compatible version of the system. I will not support earlier versions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installation:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Install the module as normal. You will see a compendium with 2 items in it. These items are upgrades and any projectile you install them in will become a burst fire weapon. </li>
    <li>No other configuration needed. Burst Fire only works in Aimed and Standard attacks. Suppressive and Autofire work RAW.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should cause little to no issues but as always you may wish to back your world up before installing.&nbsp;</p>
